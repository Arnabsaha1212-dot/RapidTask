WinFLTray.exe is an executable file associated with Folder Lock, a software developed by NewSoftwares, primarily designed for file encryption and secure storage. The version 7.7.1.0 of this application aims to provide users with enhanced privacy and security for their sensitive data. Generally considered safe when downloaded from official sources, WinFLTray.exe can sometimes trigger false positive alerts from antivirus programs due to its behavior of running in the background and accessing files. However, users should exercise caution and ensure that they are using the legitimate version of Folder Lock, as malicious variants or malware may disguise themselves with similar filenames, potentially leading to errors or security risks if the software is not properly verified. Common issues may include problems with the software not launching correctly, conflicts with other security applications, or compatibility issues with certain operating systems, which can result in user frustration if not addressed.
